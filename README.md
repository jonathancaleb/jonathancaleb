Thanks for finding yourself at my Github page! I treat Github like my second website and am constantly updating readmes and projects that I am currently invloved in. Also check out [my blog](https://caleb.github.io/) if you're curious to know what I've been dabbling in most recently besides code.

- 🧬 Recently I've been exploring the vast realms of open-source software and artificial intelligence. I believe these fields offer endless possibilities and have the potential to 
      revolutionize the way we interact with technology..
- 🍵 I'd love to collaborate on any related projects or any compelling ideas that I can take up, or just chat and answer questions about stuff outside programming.
