## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Caleb ðŸ¤–

Just a dev with too many side quests, too much coffee, and a soft spot for clean architecture.  
On a slow but steady journey to Mordor'''' one bugfix at a time.

I enjoy building things that solve real problems, learning as I go, and shipping code that doesn't scream in production.

ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!
